## Steps to Contribute

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose). 

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. See [Labels](/contributing/how-to-use-labels.md) for more information.

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. 
This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review. 


#### Make changes in the CODE

The best way to contribute is to "clone" your fork of contact-app to your development area. That sounds like some jargon, but "forking" on GitHub means 
"making a copy of that repo to your account" and "cloning" means "copying that code to your environment so you can work on it".

1. [Set up Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git) (Windows, Mac & Linux)
2. Go to the [Rakshak repo](aditi0701/Rakshak)
3. [Fork it](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)
4. [Clone](https://github.com/aditi0701/Rakshak/tree/master) your forked contact-app repo: git@github.com:<your-name>/Rakshak.git.
5. Checkout the "develop" branch. At this point you are ready to start making changes.
6. Fix existing bugs on the Issue tracker after taking a look to see nobody else is working on them.
7. [Commit](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line) the files
8. [Push](https://help.github.com/en/articles/pushing-to-a-remote) your develop branch to your fork
9. [Send a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)

We will now be alerted about the change and will respond. If your change fails to meet the guidelines it will be bounced, 
  or feedback will be provided to help you improve it.
Once we handle your pull request, we will merge it into develop and your patch will be part of the next release.
